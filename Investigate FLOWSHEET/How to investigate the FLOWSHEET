There is a problem - we don't have any metadata to use to help navigate this database. To find the correct variables...

1) Use the name search function to find the variables you are looking for.
  a) use this with the FLOWSHEETROWDIM file, which associates each ID key with a Name.
2) Then filter the results by form (using the form filter).
3) Then filter the results by distributional property.

These functions can be found in the "Working with FLOWSHEET" file in R.

4) Look at the distribution of values of the variables you are proposing to use in your population.
  a) are some of them super rare? Are some of them more common?
  b) if you filter out certain encounters, does the distribution change? It could be that these variables
are common in certain encounters more than others.

5) You can bundle variables that refer to the same clinical concept.
