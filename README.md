# UCSF De-Identified Data
A repository for projects involving UCSF's de-identified patient data

The purpose of this hub is to collect and collate the strategies, programs, and methods used to work with UCSF's de-identified files that serve as the source for their Research Data Browser.

1) Start with the preliminary folder,
2) then either combine or investigate (investigating if it is your first time using this data.
  If it is your first time, I would recommend formatting all your sources of data, and then investigating each of them individually.
  This is because some information gets lost as you combine data sources.
3) From there, look at processing patients..., and then incorporate demographics...
  Processing patients contains information on missing data imputation and cleaning this whole mess up.
