This is a list of functions for working with the FLOWSHEETVALUEFACT.csv file and the FLOWSHEETROWDIM.txt file.

PRELIMINARY STEPS:
1) The FLOWSHEETROWDIM.txt file needs to be converted to a file that can easily be read by read.csv.
There are many ways to do this. As the file currently reads, it uses white space to demarcate values.
Open the file, highlight the whitespace, and replace it with an unused character (I used !).
Demarcating with a "," will not work, because some of the entries contain a comma.

2) Get a section of the FLOWSHEETVALUEFACT.csv on some virtual machine or external harddrive (password protected).

3) Get preliminary information on your large FLOWSHEETVALUEFACT.csv file using the following programs:

get_rows - this gets you the row number of the huge file you're working with. This is important because it
makes opening a connection to the file alot easier.

piper - this function applies other functions to chunks of the file, aggregates the results, and returns them.
We use it because you likely can't read the entire file at once. If you can, just use that instead.

piper_unique_pts - this function returns the list of patients when combined with piper.
