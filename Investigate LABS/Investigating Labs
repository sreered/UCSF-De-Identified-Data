These functions are designed for investigating Lab values.
It is basically the same process as working with non-lab values, except for the following:

1) For some reason, these lab values have LOINC codes. Watch a tutorial/introduction about
that online if you don't know what those are. Then, I would recommend signing up for a LOINC
account, and using their online data dictionary to make your search easier.

2) Use that online data dictionary with the name, value form, and distribution filters to make
your search for the correct variables easy and valid.

3) In general, patients have many fewer labs than non-LOINCed values (which include all the vitals),
so you can probably upload all your labs and work with them at the same time.
