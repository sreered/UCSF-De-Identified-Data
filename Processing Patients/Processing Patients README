Patients must be processed in the following ways.
1) A block must be assigned to each time value
  a) Blocks are periods of time from the start.
    i) so for example, if the blocks are 6 hours, then a lab that occurs
    13 hours after admission would be in block 3.
2) The VARIABLES NEED TO BE CONSOLIDATED.
  a) variables of the same type in the same block need to be aggregated.
  b) this also means getting rid of the variables that aren't in the current project
3) Then we have to impute missing variables.
  a) Impute the variables in the first block.
  b) Impute the variables in the subsequent block.
